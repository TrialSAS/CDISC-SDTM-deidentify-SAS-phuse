# About The Project
This is the source code and a copy of the paper and presentation from the presentation I did at the Phuse conference in Barcelona 2016.

Most of the documentation and explanations you will find in the PowerPoint and PDF documents in the [Documents](https://github.com/jmangori/CDISC-SDTM-deidentify-SAS-phuse/Documents) folder.

The project uses the Phuse document [PHUSE_STDM_redaction.xls](http://www.phuse.eu/Data_Transparency_download.aspx) to do deidentification of SDTM datasets according to the rules defined in the spreadsheet. These rules are consideret to be identical to EMA policy 0070 on deidentification and redaction of clinical trial reports. The impelmentation is straight forward, as the rules are quite descriptive. To quuote from one of the presentations, the source codestatistics are these:

* 16 programs and macros including metadata build
* 1062 Lines of code
  * 15% comments
  * < 900 lines of code doing something
* 10 Days of work
* 5 Days of testing (15 remaining)
